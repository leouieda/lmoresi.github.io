The Science Show on ABC Radio National broadcast a fantastic opinion piece by Stephanie Pradier of AMSI (the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute) that really doesn't pull any punches in saying how important Mathematics is to the scientific endeavour. She is arguing for the reinstatement of mathematics as a prerequisite for science degrees.

"Doing anything nontrivial in science, technology, engineering or mathematics, the STEM subjects, requires a solid foundation in mathematics. Yes, we can produce people who can pass university examinations without it because we control what's in the exams. Out in the real world however, their lack of basic skills ill prepares them to perform any creative work that will contribute economically, socially or culturally."

It seems surprising that so many science degrees in Australia do not require a background in basic calculus.
