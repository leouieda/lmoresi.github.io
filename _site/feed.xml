    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;www.facebook.com/underworldcode&quot;&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt; is our parallel, particle-in-cell, finite element geodynamics code.  For the past year or so, the  &lt;a href=&quot;www.facebook.com/underworldcode&quot;&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt; team has been  working on a refurbished user interface. We’ve known for a long time that it needed to be done but we finally bit the bullet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We settled on turning underworld into a python code for two main reasons: 1) because many of our dependencies already have python bindings and 2) as we move more towards integrating with observations, it is necessary to interface with packages to pre-process data, many of which are python based or wrapped. I just thought of another one: 3) because we could. The tools for wrapping codes into python make this job much less scary than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C code base has been around for about 10 years now, has been extensively debugged and is known to work well on hundreds to thousands of processors. We have engineered some pretty robust solver methods and lots of flexibility in dealing with complex rheology. I was pretty nervous about disrupting this part of the code no matter how much we needed to improve the user-interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underworld is based on the StGermain framework  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;underlying code structure is modular and object oriented; all important entities within the code (meshes, for example) being objects that allow proper inheritance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the code is also well known for it’s none-too-friendly &lt;code&gt;xml&lt;/code&gt; based user interface and developers lament the complexity of the object model implemented in C. We have wondered for some time how to improve the user experience for newcomers and experts alike. We partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;www.geodynamics.org&quot;&gt;CIG&lt;/a&gt; to try to build a user-friendly version of underworld but, in the end, our various experiments with different approaches to running models have not significantly changed in ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The positive side of the  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been through a number of iterations on the interface and&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;Viscoelasticity has been a hidden feature of &lt;strong&gt;Underworld&lt;/strong&gt; for some time now, initially in the &lt;em&gt;experimental&lt;/em&gt; branch (alpha testing) and more recently, in the mainstream version. We did not officially release or document this implementation because it had not gone through peer review. Now, however, with Rebecca Farrington’s recent paper on viscoelastic stresses in subducting plates, the benchmarking has been published and it is time to let everyone have a go with the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation itself is very similar to that in &lt;strong&gt;Ellipsis&lt;/strong&gt; but I think we simplified the flow of the code considerably this time. The Underworld version is both 2D and 3D, and has a second order stress update (see benchmarks). Rebecca’s paper has a streamlined notation which, I think, is much closer to the physics of the problem even though we realise it is a bit dense !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to try out these models, then you should first contact &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#098;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#099;&amp;#097;&amp;#046;&amp;#102;&amp;#097;&amp;#114;&amp;#114;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#103;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#064;&amp;#109;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#104;&amp;#046;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&quot;&gt;Rebecca&lt;/a&gt;. As usual, any problems should be addressed to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://underworldproject.org/forums/&quot;&gt;underworld forum&lt;/a&gt; first of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice&quot;&gt;The viscoelastic paraphernalia are not yet released in underworld 2.0 but this is a matter of revealing the C code to the python code rather than a major re-write so it’s not a big deal and this paper will still be the best citation for the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subduction of tectonic plates into Earth’s mantle occurs when one plate bends beneath another at convergent plate boundaries. The characteristic time of deformation at these convergent boun- daries approximates the Maxwell relaxation time for olivine at lithospheric temperatures and pressures, it is therefore by definition a viscoelastic process. While this is widely acknowledged, the large-scale features of subduction can, and have been, successfully reproduced assuming the plate deforms by a viscous mecha- nism alone. However, the energy rates and stress profile within convergent margins are influenced by visco- elastic deformation. In this study, viscoelastic stresses have been systematically introduced into numerical models of free subduction, using both the viscosity and shear modulus to control the Maxwell relaxation time. The introduction of an elastic deformation mechanism into subduction models produces deviations in both the stress profile and energy rates within the subduction hinge when compared to viscous only mod- els. These variations result in an apparent viscosity that is variable throughout the length of the plate, decreasing upon approach and increasing upon leaving the hinge. At realistic Earth parameters, we show that viscoelastic stresses have a minor effect on morphology yet are less dissipative at depth and result in an energy transfer between the energy stored during bending and the energy released during unbending. We conclude that elasticity is important during both bending and unbending within the slab hinge with the resulting stress loading and energy profile indicating that slabs maintain larger deformation rates at smaller stresses during bending and retain their strength during unbending at depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary-of-the-implementation&quot;&gt;Summary of the implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stress-history&quot;&gt;Stress History&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numerical implementation of the FEM-PIC integration within Underworld requires the stress history to be carried on a particle that is immersed in the fluid and is advected and rotated as required by the velocity  \( \mathbf{u} \).  As such the stress history tensor must be transported into the current reference frame. This is possible by introducing a new operator \( \mathcal{T} \) that ensures the stress on the transported particle, p, at location \( \mathbf{x} \) and time \(t\) is objective under advection and rotation over the interval \(\Delta t\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\[
\stackrel{\vee}{\tau} _{ij} ^{t} (t, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u})&lt;br /&gt;
=  \mathcal{T} _{\Delta t}^{x _p ^{t}}\big(\tau _{ij}^{t-\Delta t}\;(\mathbf{x} _p^{t-\Delta t}), \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u} \big)
= \mathcal{L} _{1}( \tau _{ij} ^{t-\Delta t},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}) +
 \mathcal{L} _{2}( \tau _{ij} ^{t-\Delta t},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u})
  \]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where \( \mathcal{L} _1 = u _k . \partial\tau _{ij} / \partial x _k \) accounts for advection through a velocity field given by \(u _k\) and \(\mathcal{L} _2 = \tau _{ik} w _{kj} + \tau _{jk} w _{ki}\) is the Jaumann stress rate and accounts for rotation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a first order integration of the rotation term, \(\mathcal{L} _2\), produces values tangential to the rotation, thus providing an unconditionally unstable solution.
Integration of the Jaumann derivative with a minimum 2nd order accurate method is required to produce stable solutions to the rotation of the stress history term through a velocity field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that there are other terms which may be added to this definition accounting for other changes in reference frame including stretching by way of the Oldroyd derivative as discussed at length by Harder in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Including these additional terms couples stress and pressure adding a considerable complication that is not required for mathematical consistency (See Eringen) and  are not addressed further in this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-elastic-timestep&quot;&gt;The Elastic Timestep&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decoupling of the observation time and numerical time step is required.
This can be achieved by introducing an elastic timestep, \( \Delta t_e \), that ensures the required observation time is resolved, distinct from the smaller numerical timestep, \(\Delta t_c\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since \( \Delta t _e &amp;gt; \Delta t _c \), we must store the stress history over several timesteps.  This can be achieved by introducing a new term, \( \tilde{\mathcal{T}}
\), being the stress history term defined across \(n\) numerical time steps of size \( \Delta t _c\).
The stress at current time \( t \) is then defined as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\[
\tau _{ij}(\mathbf{x} _p^t) = 2\eta _{\rm{eff}}D _{ij}(\mathbf{x} _p^t) + \frac{\eta _{\rm{eff}}}{\mu\Delta t _e} \tilde{\mathcal{T}} _{\Delta t _e}^{\,x _p^t}(\stackrel{\vee}{\tau} _{ij}^{t-\Delta t _e})
\]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the presence of \( \Delta t _ e \) in both the definition of \( \tilde{\mathcal{T}} \) and in the denominator of the preceding term, with \( \eta _ {\rm{eff}} \) now defined as \( ( \eta\Delta t _e ) / ( \alpha + \Delta t _e) \). Moresi et al, 2003, showed that a running average of the stress history could be used, defined as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\[
T _{ij}^{t}(\mathbf{x} _p^{\, t})  = \big( 1 - \phi \big)\; \tilde{\mathcal{T}} _{\Delta t _c}^{\,x _p^t} \Big( T _{ij}^{t-\Delta t _c}(\mathbf{x} _p^{\,t-\Delta t _c}) \Big)  + \phi \tau _{ij}^{\,t}(\mathbf{x} _p^{\,t})
\]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where \(\phi = \Delta t _c / \Delta t _e &amp;lt; 1 \), recalling here that the transport operator has ensured the stresses are advected and rotated into the current reference frame.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I was fortunate to have the opportunity to tag along to visit the island of Timor (both West and East) to observe the seismic deployment led by the University of Southern California  to study &lt;em&gt;“Transitions in the Banda Arc-Australia continental collision as a bridge to understanding mantle and lithospheric controls on surface tectonics.”&lt;/em&gt;  You can read all about the installation and operation of the array at &lt;a href=&quot;http://bandaarc.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;bandaarc.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a really fascinating part of the world for many, many reasons but the one which fascinates me from a scientific point of view is that it is an active collision / accretion event on Australia’s doorstep. This is a case where active tectonics is influencing the state of the Australian plate very directly and one where the kinds of models we do with Underworld can be useful in disentangling the nature of the collision and the fate of the slab and the plate boundary as the collision progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2014, when all the permits were in place, we travelled to Kupang to discuss some potential sites. We visited the magnetic observatory in Kupang where there is a second world war bunker converted to a test ban monitoring station. For obvious reasons it is in a tamper-proof box and it is probably fortunate that we didn’t actually manage to get inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://user-image.logdown.io/user/7331/blog/7268/post/258172/NoDmSol5QoKjVKfS5z2E_14-09-16-DSCF3587.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://user-image.logdown.io/user/7331/blog/7268/post/258172/NoDmSol5QoKjVKfS5z2E_14-09-16-DSCF3587.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt; This is a local filling station !
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure in West Timor is basic and sometimes baffling.  Kupang is busy and chaotic and I was struck by the contrast with the smaller villages outside the town which were scrupulously tidy despite the very evident poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://user-image.logdown.io/user/7331/blog/7268/post/258172/fm69rDVVTYCt584QYlhE_14-09-17-DSCF3595.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://user-image.logdown.io/user/7331/blog/7268/post/258172/fm69rDVVTYCt584QYlhE_14-09-17-DSCF3595.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rote island is off the South Western tip of the Timor mainland and very remote by any standard. It’s just the spot to put an instrument or two. Searching for places to install seismometers is a lesson in compromise: away from people and noise but somewhere that somebody can keep an eye out to keep prying fingers and hungry animals at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    	&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rote has amazing surf and, consequently, plenty of infrastructure to cater for a large flux of alarminingly scraped-and-stitched tourists. Here the advanced party is busy testing some of the non-medical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network in Timor Leste was installed around a year ago (the advantages of an immature bureaucracy) and the team were collecting data and checking the instruments. Check &lt;a href=&quot;http://bandaarc.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;bandaarc.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt; for a rundown on the technical details and many wonderful images of the seismometer sites. The roads in TL are pretty rugged by anyone’s standard and transporting delicate machinery to such beautiful but isolated locations is always something of a worry (check out the road on the map above !) In these photos Leland O’Driscoll is preoccupied with the exhumation of the instrument in Same (in central TL) somewhat concerned that the original road trip might have been a bit hard on it.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back to Dili from Same, the views of the topography along the main highway are perfectly spectacular with many opportunities to look down shear drops from the window of the rapidly moving car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two intense days of driving were beginning to wear on everyone and everything.
 The landcruiser was flashing oil-pressure warning signs as our driver raced up the hills. With a nod to the medieval surgeons, the driver decided that this meant we should bleed off some oil. Having pulled out the oil filter and run the engine for a while, and satisfied himself that the car was cured, he drove a few hundred metres before the engine threatened to die. We coasted to a nearby house and transfused a bottle or two of fresh oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are spectacular views as the road hugs the mountainsides and crosses the high passes between broad valleys.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt; Heading home ...   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s great to see that school is incredibly important here. Kids appear from apparent wilderness in their school uniform and make their way in great crowds along the roadsides to school each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://user-image.logdown.io/user/7331/blog/7268/post/258172/h15TrXWHREeSNNiAbSc1_2015-03-20%2010.49.46%201.png&quot;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All along the way, life takes places in very small towns and villages that are barely discernable from the car even though there are dots on the map. It was very encouraging to see all the kids heading out to school and back but nailbiting to see how fast and close the trucks and cars are to the crowds of students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we finally came within sight of Dili at the top of a long descent, the car began to show signs of succumbing to abuse. The clutch began to malfunction and we coasted downhill for a few kilometres. Finally we ground to a halt in the middle of the street but by that stage we were only a few hundred metres to our destination. I was the most relieved because my flight was the following morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://user-image.logdown.io/user/7331/blog/7268/post/258172/FGVK0KGbT1qTnMSNCosd_2015-03-21%2008.15.50%201.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I headed out to Darwin from Dili, flying over the Eastern tip of the island. The view was inspiring. Look at these valleys drowning in sediment ! Very interesting for me since I have been working on the &lt;strong&gt;Badlands&lt;/strong&gt; code during the brief moments of quiet on this trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for the third time, let me plug the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bandaarc.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;official site&lt;/a&gt; for this project and thank the USC team for their tolerance in letting me come along to observe and learn.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;For the past six months or so, I have been working on the launch of a new Open Access journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://cogentoa.tandfonline.com/journal/oage20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cogent Geoscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. My first thought when I was asked if I would be interested in leading this project was &lt;em&gt;“another journal … really ?”&lt;/em&gt; but I did spend some time to discuss the whole idea with the staff at Taylor &amp;amp; Francis and my friends and colleagues, and I thought that there might indeed be an opportunity to do something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publishing landscape has shifted significantly over the past decade or so. The availability of publication-quality preprints (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arxiv.org&quot;&gt;www.arxiv.org&lt;/a&gt; and datasets on the web has forced the peer-review publication process to become significantly more responsive. Academic social-media sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.academia.edu&quot;&gt;academia.edu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.researchgate.net&quot;&gt;researchgate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.figshare.com&quot;&gt;figshare&lt;/a&gt; have created a grey-market in scientific results which have not been formally peer reviewed but which are available for discussion and comment. Traditional journals are rapidly evolving to compete in this environment and it is not entirely clear what the outcome will be !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cogent Geoscience is emerging into this uncertain environment with very little baggage from the previous era, but also very little momentum. What do we have to offer authors of high-impact research ? For one thing, the entire Cogent series is Open Access which means that all content is available for redistribution and re-publication under a creative commons licence. This is very much in keeping with the way people tend to use information - sharing and commenting, distributing and linking. Open Access is increasingly required for research supported by public funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open Access&lt;/em&gt; has, in the past, tended to be an expensive option for authors but we are now offering a different approach which allows authors to contribute whatever they consider reasonable towards the cost of publication. Specifically:
&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;every author will have the option to make a contribution towards the costs of open access publication if their article is accepted, but no one will have the obligation to pay anything. Authors will be free to choose exactly how much they wish to contribute based on their own specific circumstances, and their choice will be accepted on a ‘no questions asked’ basis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also hope that we can add to this platform an editorial enthusiasm for the discipline which will provide a platform to highlight the best and most exciting research in the field, relevant commentary, and links to re-use of our material. In other words, a great place to learn about the latest developments in the geosciences in the very broadest sense.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;overview-of-global-modeling-of-plate-behaviour--the-eating-habits-of-subduction-zones&quot;&gt;Overview of global modeling of plate behaviour &amp;amp; the eating habits of subduction zones&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://user-image.logdown.io/user/7331/blog/7268/post/205529/P4k6RvMITIGCPOzTPsh8_SampleImage.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deep Carbon Observatory hosted a workshop at the Carnegie Institute in Washington DC to learn about the state of the art in modeling of the deep, long-term, global carbon cycle. There is a lot of information coming from the field of geochemistry which provides information on local fluxes, the existence of reservoirs and the relation to other large-scale geochemical cycles. The modeling community is, however, faced with a horrible difficulty — to get this right we first have to be able to have well-constrained global models of plate tectonics, these then we need really high-fidelity physical / chemical models of the multiphase flow in subduction zones and mid-ocean ridges. Having done that, we should put those together and try to work back through all of geological time. That would give a rough basic machinery to bolt together with ocean, atmosphere, surface process modeling, computational petrology etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a pretty big challenge, but if there is any hope in making it tractable, it is in the fact that this is not a unique challenge to this particular problem but actually is a good summary of the leading edge of geodynamics today and the outstanding problems we are collectively trying to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, an intense meeting with lots of interesting discussion and great conversation. My contribution (the slides, anyway) can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/680da6e6xtys8za/SubductionAppetite-Z.pdf&quot;&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;follow-up-2015&quot;&gt;Follow up (2015)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compres meeting in Colorado Springs, July 2015 featured an interesting summary about the new DCO which appears to have undergone a metamorphosis into a dynamic modelling, big-data-driven entity as a result of the modelling meeting from last year. This is a joint effort with CIG and was probably a little undercooked at time I saw the presentation. Nevertheless, the broad sweep of where the DCO is headed aligns with the direction I see many of us heading and we are bound to meet again along the way. &lt;em&gt;[September, 2015, Melbourne]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1 id=&quot;summary-of-lessons-learned-in-developing-underworld-and-building-an-underworld-community&quot;&gt;Summary of lessons learned in developing Underworld and building an Underworld community&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://user-image.logdown.io/user/7331/blog/7268/post/197648/UDIa932hTZCMhQD18HZJ_Screen%20Shot%202014-05-08%20at%206.18.42%20am.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave a presentations at the Fall AGU meeting to the computational geodynamics community and to the GeoPrisms meeting to provide a summary of lessons learned in building Underworld, supporting the user community, and our plans for the future. This is a good time to take a snapshot of the code because the timing is the end of the NeCTAR investment into making Underworld integrate with geological workflow tools (such as GPlates, GoCAD, Litmod3D, LeCode). This presentation includes many contributions from users of those tools and I have given contact details for the people responsible. The slides are here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1342538/Talks/AGU-SF-2013/Underworld%E2%80%94AncoraImparo.pdf&quot;&gt;Talks/AGU-SF-2013/Underworld-AncoraImparo.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave a modified version of this talk as a starter for discussion at the CIG long-term tectonics / Earthscope workshop in February 2014. The slides for this talk are available from CIG, but are essentially the same as the AGU slides above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the CIG workshop in Banff, Canada, May 2014, I gave a talk to reflect on 20 years of the CITCOM family of codes. Dave May asked me to include a look-forward of 20 years as well as all the “back in my day, sonny”, reminiscing. I tried to take this seriously. My argument is this: if you want to know what the landscape is going to look at in 5 years, just be more realistic about how long it is actually going to take to get all the things working that you are busy coding today. But 20 years ? I’m arguing for us to be more vigilant about carrying uncertainty information, make a big effort to treat “a model” as meaning a whole collection of models plus their fitness-for-purpose for a given application(i.e. in some sense, having model derivatives). I believe this will give us the possibility to calculate metrics in model space and build comparisons and that this will allow us to put models in categories and develop searchable libraries. That could take some time even if it is not 20 years: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1342538/Talks/CIG-Banff-2014/CIG-CitcomBirthdayParty.pdf&quot;&gt;Talks/CIG-Banff-2014/CIG-CitcomBirthdayParty.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://user-image.logdown.io/user/7331/blog/7268/post/196560/MDZd6v0QFOp92FfinebT_ConjestedSubduction-MoresiEtAl.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our talk on congested subduction zones for the EGU session on subduction. The slides are available as a pdf file here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1342538/Talks/EGU-2014/ConjestedSubduction-MoresiEtAl.pdf&quot;&gt;Talks/EGU-2014/ConjestedSubduction-MoresiEtAl.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (movies - browse this site for links / examples). This talk covers the interaction of buoyant material with subduction zones and draws out the differences between large lumps colliding (ribbons) with smaller collisions such as plateaux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the session was focused on methods and how assumptions in models influence outcomes. My take on this is that it is possible to ask questions which can be answered independent of contingencies in the setup / simplifications. Other features of different models change according to different assumptions and these need to be examined more carefully (and maybe these are the more interesting questions). Collisions of anomolous lithosphere with subduction was an important theme of the talks - lots of new ideas !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the CGU meeting, we added some interpretation of the NW US margin in the context of our model (Thanks to Leland O’Driscoll for help on this). The “Great Alaskan Terrane Wreck” paper by Johnston was one of the inspirations for the models we ran for the SE Australia accretion study and, even though we don’t have a specific model for the NW US margin, we wanted to start up the discussion. The slides for this talk are found here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1342538/Talks/CGU-Banff-2014/ConjestedSubduction-MoresiEtAl.pdf&quot;&gt;Talks/CGU-Banff-2014/ConjestedSubduction-MoresiEtAl.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;labpax-workshop-hainberg-austria-april-2014&quot;&gt;LABPAX workshop, Hainberg, Austria, April 2014&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://user-image.logdown.io/user/7331/blog/7268/post/196181/12usvk8MS8mqmSFq9SAD_TBL.001.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the ILP Task Force LABPAX workshop in Austria, 2014, I gave an overview of thermal boundary layers and scaling for the sub-continental lithosphere. The talk slides in pdf format are at the following link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1342538/Talks/LABPAX-2014/TBLs.pdf&quot;&gt;Talks/LABPAX-2014/TBLs.pdf&lt;/a&gt;. Chiefly, this presentation is a summary of some of the relevant papers intended to promote discussion amongst a group mostly consisting of experts in seismological imaging of the deep lithosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone with a background in geodynamics, it is very clear that there are well-imaged discontinuities in the mid and deep lithosphere, but it is not always clear which of these can be attributed to the LAB. In fact, it is not at all clear to me that we have the same expectations of what the Lithosphere and Asthenosphere really are among our different communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, the PDF file has some movie snapshots - you can find links for these by browsing through my posts on continental accretion and my geodynamics videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Earth’s seismicity from a few hundred kilometres down, looking back up. Not an unfamiliar view for a geophysicist, but it may take a while to become familiar with where you are if you are not used to thinking about the Earth from the inside. The subduction zones stand out from this angle. 3D-alive also had head tracking and this view happens to be one of the best ways to view the models because you just have to stand on tip-toes to see above the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the same data but rendered from outside the Earth looking down. It’s easier to see the plate boundaries in this case but the structure of the subduction zones is not as well outlined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “missing video” from our &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13033&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; — we made 6 videos, but there is also a seventh which we only showed as a snapshot. Here is the missing movie of model &lt;em&gt;“80s”&lt;/em&gt;. There is more info &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moresi.info/posts/2014/04/02/models-of-subduction-collision-and-re-initiation&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video-presentations&quot;&gt;Video presentations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the presentation I gave at the CSDMS meeting in Boulder, CO, in 2013. They made a video and there is a transcript too (autogenerated - for those who enjoy those voice-to-email messages from google voice). Thanks to a cascade of delays on the way from Australia to Denver, I ended up giving this talk 10 minutes after getting into town … the long and frantic journey shows, unfortunately. Luckily I rented a Fiat 500 with the espresso-machine aesthetic which was painted in go-faster red !&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;notice&quot;&gt;This post was originally written for the “logdown” platform but I recently ported the whole lot across to github and their jekyll-based environment. I have therefore generalised my comments and I am showing only what works on github too. [ &lt;strong&gt;Sept 4, 2015&lt;/strong&gt; ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had a frantic phase of development in &lt;code&gt;Underworld&lt;/code&gt; recently with a new &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ipython&lt;/code&gt; compatible version in the wings. Using the &lt;code&gt;ipython notebook&lt;/code&gt; environment exclusively for a couple of weeks has rekindled my appreciation of &lt;code&gt;(multi)markdown&lt;/code&gt; for documentation and the power of rendering mathematics with &lt;code&gt;mathjax&lt;/code&gt;. I even gave a lecture this week using &lt;code&gt;ipython&lt;/code&gt; to make slides &lt;em&gt;(I wouldn’t actually recommend this, but it was interesting to be able do live demonstrations where I could modify my code to show off some numerical instabilities)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered if there was a web-hosting or blogging site that had the  markdown, mathematics, code-highlighting capabilities of ipython notebooks, and I found &lt;a href=&quot;www.logdown.com&quot; title=&quot;logdown&quot;&gt;www.logdown.com&lt;/a&gt;. This is what it can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mathematics&quot;&gt;Mathematics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Display equations rendered with mathjax as a raw displayed equation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  \\[
  S \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + H = -\frac{\partial }{\partial x}
  \underbrace{\left( - K \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} \right)}_\text{flux}
  \\]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing:
\[
  S \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + H = -\frac{\partial }{\partial x}
  \underbrace{\left( - K \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} \right)}_\text{flux}
 \]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and you can use inline equations so that you can explain, for example, what \( {\partial h}/{\partial t} \) means by using \\( … \\) tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although  &lt;code&gt;mathjax&lt;/code&gt; will parse &lt;code&gt;\begin{equation}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\end{equation}&lt;/code&gt; (etc) markup successfully in some documents, it can be pretty hit and miss just how the different processing engines will battle it all out. Luckily, mathjax is &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html&quot;&gt;highly configurable&lt;/a&gt; and you can usually find some combination of things that work. If you do use the latex &lt;code&gt;begin&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; tags, then it is possible to switch on equation numbering and labels. Who knows if this is really portable. Here is an example that works, I just had to be careful to escape the backslashes (i.e. &lt;code&gt;\\begin{equation}&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
    S \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + H = -\frac{\partial }{\partial x}
    \underbrace{\left( - K \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} \right)}_\text{flux}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
    \nabla \cdot \phi = 0
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;code&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code highlighting is also platform dependent. Markdown does this in a variety of ways, with Github using fenced code blocks and logdown adopting their strategy. In Jekyll, I found it hard to have consistent code block detection and highlighting without using the &lt;code&gt;liquid&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;code&gt;{ % highlight language % }&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{ % endhighlight % }&lt;/code&gt; tags&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code highlighting works for \( \LaTeX \),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-latex&quot; data-lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\frac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\partial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\bf&lt;/span&gt; u&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;}}{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\partial&lt;/span&gt; t&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  +
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\left&lt;/span&gt;( . &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\nabla&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\right&lt;/span&gt;)   =
    -&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\frac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;}{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\rho&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\nabla&lt;/span&gt; p  +  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\textbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;F&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  + &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\nu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\nabla&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\bf&lt;/span&gt; u&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;python scripts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;      This example shows how you can add a set of particles to a swarm.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;      Here the particles are layed out in a spiral configuration.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;      Note that Scipy / Numpy are required for this example&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;sd&quot;&gt;    &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;uwpytools&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# init using underworld 1.x XML files&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;uwpytools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InitWithArgs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;BuoyancyDrivenVanilla.xml PICellerator/PassiveTracerSwarm.xml&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stgdict&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;uwpytools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GetCurrentDictionary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# set to initialise and solve&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stgdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;maxTimeSteps&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stgdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;pauseToAttachDebugger&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stgdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;checkpointEvery&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and C code (C-like code … this is StGermain after all)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot; data-lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#include &amp;lt;math.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend the logdown platform. If you are using github, though, it is not too much of a stretch to get things working directly with Jekyll and keep everything in one spot. We’ll see, I suppose !&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://user-image.logdown.io/user/7331/blog/7268/post/192386/GkFmdzbSQ0O394T7Muc4_Congestion.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cartoon of collision / congestion&quot; width=&quot;66%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent paper [1], we used Underworld models to examine subduction congestion associated with the ingestion of a continental ribbon. The SE Australian geological record turned out to be a wonderful place to study this process. Here is a short summary of the work for a relatively non-technical audiencethat we put together and some additional figures which I prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;em&gt;Moresi, L.N., Betts, P.G., Miller, M.S., and Cayley, R.A., 2014, The Dynamics of Continental Accretion: Nature, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13033&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nature13033&lt;/a&gt;. Also see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13033.html#supplementary-information&quot;&gt;supplementary information and animations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Earth’s continents drift at a speed of just a few centimetres per year driven by the sinking of the cold tectonic plates at subduction zones. As they drift, continents collide to form great mountain belts and, in the process, incorporate an assortment of geological debris. This activity has shaped the geological record for billions of years and geologist are accustomed to finding “exotic” material mashed up in ancient mountain belts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper by Louis Moresi, Peter Betts, Meghan Miller and Ross Cayley shows how continental collisions work - how subduction zones stutter and recover when they are hit by a drifting continental fragment, and how evidence of such collisions may remain preserved largely intact in the Earth’s crust for hundreds of millions of years. The research shows how the subduction zone and the exotic continent dance around each other during the collision leaving a distinctive pattern in the rock record. The researchers predict that regions where collisions occur, crumpling up the crust into mountain belts, are flanked by low-lying zones of stretching and extension, characterised by intense localised heating, volcanic activity and fresh sediments that, till now, appeared enigmatic.  Rocks caught up in the collision  are swept around in a huge arcing path, stretched, rotated and dragged hundreds of kilometres from their original location as they chase a curved subduction zone trench retreating oceanward - a process called ‘subduction roll-back’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One place in the world where evidence of this unusual pattern had already been observed happens to be on our own doorstep. The geology of  Victoria, Tasmania, and New South Wales shows an embedded block of older continental crust which collided with SE Australia between 450 and 380 million years ago. The collision started a cascade of geological processes that resulted in a swirling pattern preserved in the surrounding rocks, exactly as predicted by the computer model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://user-image.logdown.io/user/7331/blog/7268/post/192386/WXDOHuPTeahzWe7TyFGA_Figure1.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://user-image.logdown.io/user/7331/blog/7268/post/192386/WXDOHuPTeahzWe7TyFGA_Figure1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt; Reconstruction of the Tasmanide accretionary event, showing indentation of continental ribbon material and lateral subduction. a, Stable Ordovician convergent margin immediately after accretion of VanDieland microcontinent. b, Trench advance in the southern Tasmanides and subduction rollback in the central Tasmanides during the Early Silurian resulted in a transitional configuration of back-arc extension, and high temperature metamorphism in the back arc. c, Margin parallel trench retreat behind VanDieland during the Late Silurian. Extensive arc and back-arc magmatism, and basins systems above the retreating plate leading to a Banda- type sea outboard of VanDieland. d, Re-establishment of a stable, linear convergent margin during the Early Devonian. e, Present distribution of major tectonic elements of the southern and central Tasmanides superimposed on a magnetic map of eastern Australia &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the research may explain complex geological relationships in the modern Earth, including the contorted geological patterns where the northern margin of Australian tectonic plate is colliding with smaller micro-plates of SE Asia.  Geometries predicted by the models are also seen in the tectonically active Mediterranean region in Europe, and contorted Mountain belts preserved throughout western North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results will help geologists interpret ancient Mountain belts;  this includes other parts of Eastern Australia as well as Central Asia, which are the sites of some of the largest accumulation of the Earths continents in the last 500 million years of Earth’s history. The results may prove most useful as a template to interpret regions where preservation of evidence for past collisions is incomplete - a common, and often frustrating, challenge for geologists working in fragmented ancient terranes. Geometries predicted by the models will radically redirect the focus of exploration for buried mineral systems already known to be intimately linked to the plate-tectonic process — they will occur in places not previously suspected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results will also likely provoke significant re-interpretation of some ancient deeply-buried geology, for example beneath the Antarctic icecap, where the accumulated geological history is tantalisingly revealed only as patterns in regional-scale geophysical datasets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;glossary&quot;&gt;Glossary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plate tectonics&lt;/strong&gt; — the process by which the Earth turns itself inside out, creating new sea-floor at the mid-ocean ridge and swallowing it again at subduction zones.  This process turns the Earth’s internal heat into surface motion of a few centimetres per year and provides the energy for geological change.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continental Drift&lt;/strong&gt; — the continents are shuffled, deformed, and dragged around by plate tectonics but are not recycled into the Earth by subduction zones because they are made of generally lighter rocks.  The geological record clearly records the fact that for billions of years continents have migrated continuously around the Earth’s surface: colliding with each other, rifting apart, and drifting to different climatic zones. Modern satellite-based Global Positioning System measurements confirm beyond all doubt that this process continues today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mountain Belts&lt;/strong&gt; — Mountains usually occur in long, relatively narrow chains across the Earth’s surface. This reflects the fact that subduction tends to occur along a wide region of a plate boundary and that subduction is the driving force for mountain building. So much so, that breaks in mountain belts invite special explanations such as collision of exotic crust.  Actual mountains erode very quickly in geological time, so ancient mountain belts are recognised by geology characteristic of deeply eroded mountain roots, compared directly to modern examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subduction Zone&lt;/strong&gt; — A convergent boundary between two of the Earth’s tectonic plates, whereby a denser oceanic plate sinks into the Earth’s mantle, moving beneath an overriding plate of either continental or oceanic character.  Active subduction zones are sites of volcanism, earthquakes and mountain building. Fossil subduction zones can be challenging to recognise in the rock record.&lt;/p&gt;
